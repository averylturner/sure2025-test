# Splash Mountain as a System
Avery Turner
Splash Mountain, a popular water ride on multiple Disney park properties, is a complex system that has a large number of parts. It is an attraction that is prone to malfunctions, break-downs, and overcrowding. Using MBSE to model the daily patterns of the ride can not only make these issues easier to overcome but could prevent them entirely.
